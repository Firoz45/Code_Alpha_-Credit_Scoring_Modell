# 🏦 Credit Scoring Model

## 📌 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to **predict an individual's creditworthiness** based on historical financial data. The model aims to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

---

## 🧠 Approach

This project utilizes **classification algorithms** to build predictive models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

We perform thorough feature engineering and model evaluation to ensure performance and reliability.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Feature Engineering**: Transformation and selection of meaningful features from financial history (e.g., income, debts, payment history).
- 📈 **Model Evaluation**: Assessed using industry-standard classification metrics:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- 📊 **Data Insights**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) included to understand trends and variable importance.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used includes features such as:
- Monthly income
- Outstanding debts
- Payment history
- Loan amount
- term
- defaulted
